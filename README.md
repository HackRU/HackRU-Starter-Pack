# starter-pack
Sandbox that leverages docker and OS.JS to allow hackers to easily have an enviornment to code. 

The major goal is to allow hackathon sponsors or people running tech talks (like hacker hour) to upload their code and examples to our backend and will allow hackers to easily get acess to this code. This ensures that the setup process is minimized
