#starter-pack

## Description
* A programming sandbox meant for developers to easily code and avoid setup
* The hope is to allow for full GUI sessions (X sessions) so that newbies are not confined to an uncomfortable shell.
* We can initialise (hopefully) with arbitrary Docker images so that users can try almost anything out.
* Users (may be) able to host their hacks off their sandbox.
* The main idea is to have a (somewhat) central server that users can use. This'll help us keep things organized.

## Inspiration
* The OG starter pack being worthless.
* Andrea was like "why not take codecademy, but like do the whole thing?"
* Heman and Sri came up with crazy ideas

## Installation Guide
* TBD - see the dev branch, x-and-osjs for now.

## Example Uses

* Useful for hacker hours and tech talks and for hackru api demos and using api's
* Saves installation time.

## Style Guide

TBA
